    <title>SOAP templates for xincoDMS - Interaction with the xincoDMS server</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Interaction with the xincoDMS server</h1>
    <p>xincoDMS is a document management system written in Java. It is a typical web application that comprises
    several Java servlets and resides in a Servlet container (like Apache Tomcat). Communication with the system
    is done via a web service. This means that there is a particular servlet which receives HTTP requests from any
    client and tries to perform the desired action. Naturally the requests must be transmitted in a special format
    that the servlet can understand - SOAP is the magic keyword here. The requests to the xincoDMS server as well as
    the reponses from the server are SOAP messages. This is an XML-based networking protocol designed for the
    communication with a web service.</p>
    <p>A typical SOAP message looks like this (taken from Wikipedia):</p>
    <p class="code">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br />
    &lt;s:Envelope xmlns:s=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope&quot;&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;s:Header&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/s:Header&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;s:Body&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/s:Body&gt;<br />
    &lt;/s:Envelope&gt;</p>
    <p>The root element of a SOAP message is always the envelope. It contains an optional header element and the
    body of the message. Inside the body element there can be any XML structure. Typically it contains an element
    node describing the operation that should be performed and might comprise additional elements with input
    parameters required for the action.</p>
    <p>The messages exchanged by the xincoDMS client and server applications follow this specification. The XML
    structure of certain requests has been recorded in these SOAP templates. As mentioned before the SOAP messages
    are transferred via HTTP - just like a normal web pape. To ensure a successful transmission the XML document
    must be sent with the POST method and the following HTTP headers:</p>
    <p class="code">Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8<br />
    Content-Length: 1234<br />
    SOAPAction: &quot;&quot;</p>
    <p>The content length must be set to the size of the XML document (in bytes). If you use the SOAP templates
    provided in this package the UTF-8 encoding is just right. Otherwise you might have to change the character
    encoding as well. Note that the SOAPAction parameter can always be an empty string.</p>
    <p>A schematic HTTP request sent to the web service might look like this:</p>
    <p class="code">POST /xinco/services/Xinco HTTP/1.1<br />
    Host: 192.168.0.128<br />
    Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8<br />
    Content-Length: 1234<br />
    SOAPAction: &quot;&quot;<br />
    <br />
    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;<br />
    &lt;s:Envelope xmlns:s=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope&quot;&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;s:Header&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/s:Header&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;s:Body&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!-- The content of the SOAP request goes here! --&gt;<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/s:Body&gt;<br />
    &lt;/s:Envelope&gt;</p>
    <p>The real requests as printed in the SOAP templates are far more complex with a deeply nested XML structure.</p>
    <p>With this knowledge and the possibility to send data over a HTTP connection you are able to interact with
    the xincoDMS server from any programming language. After all it is just some extensive text processing which
    can be handled by a suitable XML parser very easily.</p>
