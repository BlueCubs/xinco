    <title>SOAP templates for xincoDMS - create_log.xml</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>create_log.xml</h1>
    <p>This SOAP request provides a fundamental feature for many operations with data objects inside the xincoDMS
    repository. It enables you to create log entries which are required for any operation on data objects.</p>
    <p>The response contains a XincoCoreLog object with its ID and the complete information you provided.</p>
    <p>Log entries are an essential component of xincoDMS. You must create such entries for each and every action
    you perform on data objects, including upload, check-in, check-out, modification of meta-information etc.
    Downloading an object for reading does not require any logging.</p>
    <h2>Basic parameters</h2>
    <p>The text content of the following element nodes has to be adjusted:</p>

    <p><b>Hint:</b> Each of the XPath queries above will return an element node. To modify its content you will
    have to go down to its text node which is typically the first child. Be prepared that some elements might not
    have a text node by default. You may have to create a child text node first.</p>
