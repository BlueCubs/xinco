===============================

Follow the basic xinco DMS install instructions, BUT instead of configuring xinco DMS in Tomcat's context.xml file, do the following:

1) Copy MySQL Connector mysql-connector-java-xxx-stable-bin.jar to [JBOSS]/server/default/lib

2) Copy xinco-ds.xml (datasource config) from this package to [JBOSS]/server/default/deploy and edit user/password settings and connection-url if necessary.

3) Modify your downloaded xinco DMS Server distribution by copying web.xml and jboss-web.xml from this package to [xinco]/webapps/xinco/WEB-INF and edit env-entry settings in web.xml (especially the full paths in env-entry: xinco/FileRepositoryPath / xinco/FileIndexPath / xinco/FileArchivePath).

4) Package a WAR file from your modified xinco DMS Server using the Windows batch / Unix Shell file.

5) Copy xinco.war to [JBOSS]/server/default/deploy

6) Start jBoss!


If your database connection details are configured correctly in xinco-ds.xml and your environment settings in web.xml are correct, everything should work fine!

Tested on: jboss-4.0.1RC2
