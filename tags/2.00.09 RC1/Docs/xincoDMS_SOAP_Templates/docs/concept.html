    <title>SOAP templates for xincoDMS - Concept of the SOAP templates</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Concept of the SOAP templates</h1>
    <p>The SOAP templates for xincoDMS have been extracted from the low-level communication between the XincoExplorer
    client and the document management server. This process was well supported by the SOAPMonitor applet which is
    available to any modern Apache Axis implementation.</p>
    <p>Originally this step of monitoring the fundamental XML-based communication between client application and
    web service has been taken in order to get an idea how to interact with the xincoDMS server from a programming
    language other than Java. In the particular project the server should be queried by a Visual Basic 6.0
    application which did not support the xincoDMS API of course but neither supported SOAP as well. So the only
    way to knock the two systems into transmission was to go down to the basics of the SOAP communication.</p>
    <p>After the SOAP messages exchanged between client and server had been monitored by the SOAPMonitor applet they
    were optimized and simplified a little bit because Axis produces quite horrible XML documents. Even now the files
    are still filled with lots of namespace definitions and prefixes. This makes handling the SOAP templates a little
    bit more difficult since you might get confused or disoriented very easily. If you want to explore the files in
    a text editor I highly recommend you one with node folding like
    <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/">Notepad++</a>. This can help you not to lose yourself in the
    large document.</p>
    <p>For every interaction with the xincoDMS server there is a certain SOAP operation. Some tasks even require
    more than one request to complete the action. There is a set of pre-configured SOAP templates available in
    this package. Naturally you will have to put in adequate values at some positions in the document. There are
    help files for each SOAP template which describe the operation and what values need to be configured before
    sending the request to the server. The easiest way to cope with this XML modification is to use XPath. If you
    are not familiar with this technique then now is the right time to learn more about this query language. Do
    not even think of navigating through the SOAP messages element by element. You would get frustrated very soon.</p>
    <p>If your programming language offers a DOM implementation (e.g. VB.NET and C# do so) you can parse the SOAP
    template into a DOM object and use XPath to modify the required parameters. Then just send this XML code via
    HTTP to the xincoDMS web service and wait for the response. Since the answer is also an XML document you can
    parse it into a DOM object as well and fetch the desired results with respective XPath queries.</p>
