    <title>SOAP templates for xincoDMS - Frequently Asked Questions</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>In this part of the documentation some frequently questions should be addressed. Please excuse me if your
    question is not listed here. I will not go into detail with certain programming languages. So this is where
    your own creativity is challenged.</p>
    <h2>What do I need for the communication with xincoDMS?</h2>
    <p>Actually you only need the following components to achieve a successful communication betwenn any client
    application and the xincoDMS server:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The SOAP templates in this package</li>
      <li>A programming language supporting XML (and XPath) and HTTP communication</li>
      <li>Some experience with XML and HTTP or a powerful coffee machine in case you are new to the topic ;)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How do I send a request to xincoDMS?</h2>
    <p>First of all you should load the appropriate SOAP template from this package. Then use an XML parser
    (with XPath) to obtain the nodes described in the usage documentation and fill in your own values. Finally
    send the modified XML document via HTTP to the xincoDMS web service.</p>
    <p>Please remember that some operations like uploading a new file are done in multiple steps. Be sure to
    comply with the step-by-step procedure or your action will fail.</p>
    <h2>My requests take unashamedly long to complete. What can I do?</h2>
    <p>If this behaviour occurs during the upload or download of binary data it might be quite normal if your files
    have a certain size. Due to the Base64 encoding of the data the volume gets inflated by additional 30%.
    Remember that most private internet connections are asymmetric in up- and downstream. So the upload of data
    to the server might take much longer than downloading.</p>
    <p>If you experience such a phenomenon in a search operation you have probably sent a query which returns many
    results. So the server response can be quite large. Make sure you specify your search in many details to
    reduce the number of matches.</p>
    <h2>How do I delete an object from the repository?</h2>
    <p>Indeed this does not go the obvious way since there is no &quot;Delete&quot; request. If you want to remove
    a data object or folder from the repository you have to move it to the &quot;Trash&quot; folder. Use the
    <a href="create_file.html">create_file.xml</a> request for files or the
    <a href="create_folder.html">create_folder.xml</a> request for folders and always set the <b>ID of the parent</b>
    folder to <b>2</b> - this is the pre-definied value for the trash.</p>
    <p>Note that the files and folders are not deleted automatically. The administrator of your xincoDMS server has
    to empty the trash from time to time. This is done in the XincoAdmin interface.</p>
    <h2>Why are there no templates for locking, commenting and publishing data?</h2>
    <p>These operations (and some more) were not required in the context of the project which lead to these SOAP
    templates. You can build these files on your own by using the SOAPMonitor applet available for Axis.</p>
